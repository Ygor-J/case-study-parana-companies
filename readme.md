## Goal

The context is:

Imagine a random company is trying to set up a new branch or sell a new product in the brazilian state of Parana, located in South Brazil.
It's a B2B (Bussiness to Bussines) product.

The question is:

- Given we look at public datasets of brazilian government, how can we understand and plan the selling of this specific product?
